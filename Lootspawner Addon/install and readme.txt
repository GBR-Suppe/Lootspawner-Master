Full credits go to: Ed! (404Forums) and [GoT] JoSchaap (GoT2DayZ.nl) for the initial spawnsystem for Wasteland and Na_Palm !

I have only packed the Lootspawner in a beautiful autostart addon.
Very good, because now lazy people can no longer view or steal your settings.

Install:
1.0		Configure the Lootspawner:
1.1 	'Lootspawner.sqf' to change the available variables as needed.
		(ex. spawninterval, chance of loot, categories of loot...)
1.2 	'LSlootLists.sqf' to customize the items inside the categories.
1.3 	'LSlootBuildings.sqf' to change the lootcategory of a building or add/remove buildings.

2.0		pack the pbo back together after configure.

3.0		Copy the "loot_addon.pbo" into the folder "@epochhive\addons\"

4.0		And ready :-) remove the old LSpawner folder and everything from the LSpawner into your init.sqf (into your epoch.mission)

4.1 	There is nothing in the init.sqf necessary, the lootaddon starts completely alone.



If you need more information, send me a PM in the Forums.

Have fun and thanks for taking your time!
